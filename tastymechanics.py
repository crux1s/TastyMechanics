# ==========================================
# TastyMechanics v25.11
# ==========================================
#
# Changelog
# ---------
# v25.11 (2026-02-28)
#   - REFACTOR: Six tab render functions extracted from main() into module-level
#     scope (render_tab0-render_tab5). main() reduced from 2,191 to 875 lines.
#     Each function receives only the variables it uses -- explicit interfaces,
#     no hidden closure dependencies. Paves way for file-per-tab splitting.
#   - REFACTOR: Union-Find helpers (_uf_find, _uf_union, _group_symbols_by_order)
#     extracted from build_closed_trades() closure to module level in mechanics.py.
#     Now independently importable and testable.
#   - REFACTOR: _write_test_snapshot refactored from 22 positional parameters to
#     a single ctx dict -- eliminates parameter ordering errors, trivial to extend.
#   - REFACTOR: Time window selection replaced 7-branch if/elif chain with
#     _WINDOW_START dict lookup.
#   - TESTING: Suite expanded 185 -> 258 tests (23 sections). Four new sections:
#     closed trade core aggregates, strategy breakdown, close types & debit trades,
#     window filtering. Three VERIFIED tests cross-checked against live TastyTrade UI.
#   - TESTING: CSV discovery accepts tastymechanics_*.csv in addition to tastytrade_*.csv.
#   - FIX: build_option_chains() empty-DataFrame guard added -- prevented crash on
#     tickers with no option history in the filtered window.
#   - UI: Portfolio Overview metric captions rewritten -- consistent length,
#     Cap Efficiency description halved, Account Age note improved.
#
# v25.10 (2026-02-28)
#   - FIX: realized_ror now recomputed after zero-cost exclusion filter so it
#     always reflects the final total_realized_pnl in both code paths.
#     Previously the ROR card showed the pre-filter value when the exclusion
#     toggle was on. (Review finding #6)
#   - FIX: pure_options_pnl() window boundary changed from <= to < for closed
#     campaigns. An option closing on the same date as a share sale was silently
#     excluded from all P/L buckets. Open campaign windows now use no upper
#     bound rather than a df['Date'].max() sentinel. (Review finding #3)
#   - FIX: FIFO engine zero-qty guard added to BUY path pps calculation.
#     A misclassified corporate action row with qty=0 and total!=0 would have
#     raised ZeroDivisionError; now returns pps=0.0 safely. (Review finding #1)
#   - REFACTOR: is_share_row() / is_option_row() moved from ui_components.py to
#     ingestion.py — their correct home alongside equity_mask() / option_mask().
#     ui_components.py re-exports them for backwards compatibility.
#     mechanics.py now imports them from ingestion, restoring the strict
#     one-way dependency chain. (Review finding #9)
#
# v25.9 (2026-02-27)
#   - NEW: Win Rate & Avg P/L by DTE at Open charts (Trade Analysis tab).
#     Two-column view showing win rate and avg P/L per DTE bucket (0–7d through
#     61–90d). LEAPS excluded. Reveals where your edge is strongest by DTE.
#   - NEW: Rolling 90-day Capital Efficiency chart (All Trades tab).
#     13-week rolling P/L annualised against deployed capital. S&P 10% benchmark
#     line. Rising = capital working harder; flat/falling = sizing drift.
#   - NEW: Campaign P/L Waterfall chart (Wheel Campaigns tab, per campaign).
#     Shows Share Cost → Premiums → Dividends → Exit Proceeds → Net P/L as a
#     stacked waterfall. Makes the "house money" story visually obvious.
#   - FIX: Zero-cost basis exclusion toggle — sidebar opt-in to exclude
#     tickers with spin-off / ACATS $0-basis deliveries from all portfolio
#     P/L metrics (ROR, Capital Efficiency, Realized P/L). FIFO engine
#     unchanged; filtered at display layer only.
#   - FIX: Realized ROR now shows '∞ house money' when net_deposited < 0
#     (withdrawn more than deposited) and 'N/A' when net_deposited == 0,
#     rather than the misleading 0.0% previously returned in both cases.
#   - FIX: Capital Efficiency Score now shows 'N/A' when no capital is
#     deployed, rather than 0.0%.
#   - FIX: 5-day window changed to 7-day (Last 7 Days) so prior-period
#     comparison always aligns Mon-Sun vs Mon-Sun — equal trading days.
#
# v25.9 (2026-02-26)
#   - FIX: Assignment STO double-count — pre-purchase option that caused a
#     put assignment was being counted in both campaign premiums AND the
#     outside-window P/L bucket. Fixed: assignment STO stays solely in the
#     outside-window bucket. Verified against real account data.
#   - FIX: Windowed P/L and All Time P/L both missing dividends and interest.
#     Income now included in both window_realized_pnl and total_realized_pnl.
#   - FIX: Standalone ticker equity P/L replaced cash-flow approximation with
#     proper FIFO engine — correct for accounts with open equity positions.
#   - FIX: option_mask() typo introduced in v25.7 refactor (wrong function name
#     and wrong DataFrame at two call sites).
#   - TEST: 180-test suite (test_tastymechanics.py) added. All P/L figures,
#     campaign accounting, windowed views, and edge cases verified against
#     independently computed ground truth from raw CSV data.
#
# v25.8 (2026-02-26)
#   - REFACTOR: load_and_parse() returns ParsedData NamedTuple.
#     detect_corporate_actions() now runs exactly once.
#   - REFACTOR: equity_mask() / option_mask() vectorised helpers replace
#     scattered .str.strip() comparisons throughout.
#   - REFACTOR: AppData dataclass confirmed clean; all dict access migrated
#     to attribute access.
#
# v25.6 (2026-02-26)
#   - FIX: Stock splits (forward and reverse) handled end-to-end. Pre-split
#     lot sizes rescaled in FIFO engine; split REMOVAL rows no longer trigger
#     false P/L or duplicate campaigns. Warning banner shown at load time.
#   - FIX: Zero-cost share deliveries (spin-offs, ACATS transfers) flagged
#     with an amber warning noting the $0 basis will overstate P/L on sale.
#   - FIX: Timezone architecture unified — single UTC conversion in
#     load_and_parse(), naive datetimes everywhere downstream.
#   - FIX: Short equity FIFO — buy-to-cover now correctly matches the
#     originating short lot instead of treating proceeds as costless gain.
#   - FIX: Naked long options (LEAPS) no longer mislabelled as debit spreads.
#   - FIX: LEAPS excluded from ThetaGang DTE metrics (DTE > 90 threshold).
#   - FIX: Weekly bar chart hover negative formatting.
#   - REFACTOR: AppData dataclass, _iter_fifo_sells() shared FIFO core,
#     APP_VERSION constant, XSS prevention via xe() helper.
#
# v25.4 (2026-02-24)
#   - FIX: Pre-purchase options no longer credited to campaign effective basis.
#     Real impact: SMR basis corrected from $16.72 → $20.25/share.
#   - FIX: Prior period P/L double-counting.
#   - FIX: CSV validation, negative currency formatting, trade log date sort.
#   - NEW: How Closed column (Expired / Assigned / Exercised / Closed).
#   - NEW: Total Realized P/L by Week & Month charts.
#   - NEW: Window date label on all section headers.
#
# v25.3 (2026-02-23)
#   - NEW: Expiry alert strip (21-day lookahead, colour-coded urgency).
#   - NEW: Period comparison card (current vs prior window with deltas).
#   - NEW: Weekly / Monthly P/L bar charts.
#   - NEW: Open Positions card grid with strategy badges and DTE progress bars.
#   - UI: IBM Plex Sans + Mono typography, dark theme (#0a0e17).
